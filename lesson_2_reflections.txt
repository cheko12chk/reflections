Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A. When a repository is initialized, it will create the new repository in the computer where the command was executed (locally).
	We need it so that git will keep track of the documents we place in such repository, whenever we make changes to it and commit them, git will keep a history of the changes that were made.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	A. The staging area is just a space we can manipulate before commiting changes for good to the repository, I assume we can remove files from the staging area as we can add them and decide when to submit those changes to the repository.
